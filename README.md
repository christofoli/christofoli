### Greetings! :wave:
My name is Felipe Christofoli.

I’m a professional focused on designing and developing web solutions with HTML, CSS — Sass, Less, Bootstrap etc —, and JS tools — JQuery, TypeScript, React, Node.js etc. In the meantime, I do some scratching with Python, PHP and SQL just for fun.
