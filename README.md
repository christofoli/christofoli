### Greetings! :wave:
My name is Felipe Christofoli.

I’m a professional focused on designing and developing web solutions with HTML, CSS — Sass, Less, Bootstrap etc —, and JS tools — JQuery, TypeScript, React, Node.js etc. I love to combine all of that with solid knowledge in design processes regarding UI, UX, web/mobile apps and more.
